	<p class="bodyText"><em>My name is Ninj Namjig, I am 10 years old. I am creating website to inform (And might entertain!) you about music, literature, and other things I explore. It's Music Episode!</em></p>
	<p>So, let's start with W.A.Mozart. To me, he is start of Romanticism (Because his earlier pieces are Romanticism-like) and influenced later composers such as Ludwig van Beethoven.</p>
	<p>If you think he was always stuck to Classicalism, then, listen to his Piano Concerto No.20, first movement and Fantasy in D minor. They seem wonderful, yet grander, and says Mozart wasn't always stuck to Classicalism. When I first listened to that, I wasn't sure that Mozart wrote it. But still, he is a genius and and that doesn't matter (That he is born in the Dynasty of Classical Music). Here's his portrait:</p>

	<p class="bodyText">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (a.k.a Wolferl) was born in Salzburg, Austria, on 27 January 1756. He was baptized as Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart. He was the youngest child of Leopold Mozart and Anna Maria Mozart nee Pertl.He was a child prodigy, which means that he composed music in a young age. <em>He  started composing when he was 5 years old, (And here, I am writing two series ).</em> He traveled over the Europe, and being famous.He married Constanze Weber a.k.a Stanzi. He died of some-illness-that-I-don't-want-to-say-it's-name, on 5 December 1791.</p>
	<p>And here, I have put the links of Wolferl's Piano Concerto No.20 and Fantasia in D Minor:

	<p>As I know, Mozart kept a dog, a starling, a horse and a canary. And he was such a joker! Because he wrote scatological music and letters, including "Leck mich im Arsch". I advice you to not to translate it to English or your native language. Because the translation is always not-so-good. Even I was shocked. If you know German or from a German speaking countries, (I am not being ridiculous, but the result is nearly-regretting to me) then, both bad luck and good luck. I barely believed that he wrote that. But, I might protect him for that. Because, he is now my favorite composer (At first, I found his music boring) firstly, secondly, that jokes like this wouldn't appear that a lot, especially among composers. I promise, not in a century! (It's just I think)</p>
	<p>Wolferl was a small-but-taller-than-Beet-field (He is Beethoven, of course). He had a white face with a large, intense eyes, and a curlyish fair hair. As Stanzi said, when he spoke"it was rather soft and delicate in singing". But, I think he could be really, really <em>odd</em> sometimes. Despite his smallpoxed face, <em>he loved elegant clothes</em>, which made him look like a <em>fool</em>. I am not insulting him, but thinking of him wearing with a crimson pelisse and a gold-laced cock hat... Not a thing that comes to imagine and me keeping a straight face... I can't even stop myself giggling when looking at his face... To me wearing a pelisse and a cock hat, I would rather wear a humble clothes (Because of my too-much humbleness, I might be saying that).</p>
	<p>Wolferl's name meant "walking in wolf den". And their family name were actually Mozthardt, not Mozart.</p>
	<p><em>So, I have told you some short introduction about him. Later, I will tell you about others, such as Beethoven! Bye for now!</em></p>
